On Janurary 4th, 2024 I bought 10 bags of French Fries from my local Meijer in Lansing. From each bag, I randomly sampled approximately 12 fries. Each sample of fries was then randomly ordered using the `RAND()` function in excel. Fry samples were cooked two at a time (i.e. two samples per tray) in a standard oven preheated to 425 degrees fahrenheit. Each tray was cooked for 8 minutes on the bottom oven rack, then flipped, then cooked for another 8 minutes on the top oven rack. Then, tray were removed from the oven and allowed to cool for at least one minute. Taste testers were given each fry in their randomized order, allowing approximately 3 minutes to taste the fry and record their scores before moving onto the next fry. Testers also took freehand notes on each fry.
